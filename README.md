Pepperz Garden is an Arduino based interactive gardening system.  The system will monitor soil moisture levels, tweet you when water is low and even water on your behalf. 

This project is based on the Botanicalls project by Rob Faludi, Kate Hartman, and Kati London.  See more at:  www.botanicalls.com 

This system goes one step further than the base botanicalls system by adding in automated watering capabilities.
