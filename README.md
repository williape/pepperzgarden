Pepperz Garden is an Arduino based interactive gardening system. The system will monitor soil moisture levels, tweet you when your plants need water and even water on your behalf.

This project is based on Botanicalls by Rob Faludi, Kate Hartman, and Kati London. See more at: www.botanicalls.com

This system goes one step further than the base botanicalls system by adding in automated watering capabilities and (coming soon) the ability to respond to twitter requests.

Project material is organised as such:

Designs: Breadboard designs, Fritzing designs, schematics and bill of materials
ArduinoProject: Arduino code
ArduinoLibraries: External Arduino libraries
