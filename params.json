The system will monitor soil moisture levels, tweet you when water is low and even water on your behalf. \r\n\r\nThis project is based on the Botanicalls project by Rob Faludi, Kate Hartman, and Kati London.  See more at:  www.botanicalls.com \r\n\r\nThis system goes one step further than the base botanicalls system by adding in automated watering capabilities. \r\n\r\nFolders are as such:\r\n* Designs: Project breadboard designs, schematics and bill of materials\r\n* ArduinoProject: Arduino code \r\n* ArduinoLibraries: External Arduino libraries  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 United States License.
