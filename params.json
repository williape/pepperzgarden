The system will monitor soil moisture levels, tweet you when your plants need water and even water on your behalf. \r\n\r\nThis project is based on Botanicalls by Rob Faludi, Kate Hartman, and Kati London.  See more at:  www.botanicalls.com \r\n\r\nThis system goes one step further than the base botanicalls system by adding in automated watering capabilities and (coming soon) the ability to respond to twitter requests. \r\n\r\nProject material is organised as such:\r\n* Designs: Breadboard designs, [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) designs, schematics and bill of materials\r\n* ArduinoProject: Arduino code \r\n* ArduinoLibraries: External Arduino libraries  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 United States License.
